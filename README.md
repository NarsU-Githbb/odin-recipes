Project about recipes 

in this project I wish to demonstrate my HTML basics knowledge such as:

-Basic structure of html (boilerplate)
-Basic elements & tags
-Images & links
-Lists

etc.

ps. This is my first project ever so I couldn't help myself being a little silly while making it. I'll promise to grow up in the future!
