        <li>   1 teaspoon coconut oil

                    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlics
        
                        <li> 1 teaspoon sesame oil
        
                            <li> 2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles
        
                                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>


    </ul>

    <h4> Directions:</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
            <li> Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
            <li> Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
<li> While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
<li> Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.

    </ol>
