    <h3> That raw fish classic from the east!</h3>
    What is the best way to make the most delicious tasting sushi you have ever eaten? I guess we are gonna find out some answers to that question relatively soon!
    <h4> Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>2 ¼ cups Japanese sushi-style rice</li>

<li> 1 (4 inch) piece konbu dried kelp (Optional)
    
<li> 3 cups water
    
<li>  ¼ cup rice vinegar
    
<li> ¼ cup white sugar
    
    <li> ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>

<h4> Directions:</h4> 
<ol>
<li>Place rice into a large, deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns milky white. Pour off cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat 3 or 4 times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water.</li>
<li>Drain rice in a fine strainer, then place into a saucepan along with konbu and 3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved in a small bowl; set aside. </li>
<li> Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard konbu. Stir in vinegar mixture until well incorporated and no lumps of rice remain. Allow to cool at room temperature. For a shinier appearance, use an electric fan to cool rice rapidly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dont forget your soy sauce! </p>
